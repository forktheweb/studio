Examples
========

The exampleServices folder contains all the services used by the examples, as you will see
the services implementation is independent of the framework.

The hello-* folders contains web development frameworks implementations, you can
pick anyone and start your study.

To run the examples, you can navigate to the hello-* folder and execute "node index.js"
or you can navigate to project's root folder and execute "grunt example:* "
(where * is the name of the web development framerwork, i.e "grunt example:express")
